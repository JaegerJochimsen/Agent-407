# Agent-407
A Garden Defense-based FPS 

# Premise
Agent 407 is a quirky twist on an FPS in which you play a Garden Gnome, Gideon. Your job as a protector of the Garden is to rid the Garden of dangrous pests.
Roam around and exterminate the buggos, but be careful! They're fiercer than they look and they're hungry for Gnome Porcelain.

# Logistics/Stats
The FPS is written in C# using the Unity Enginge and (right now during development) is using prefabricated models. Original enemy and weapon models are in the works and will be included with the game's alpha verison. Credit to various youtube videos and forumns have been linked in the source files they pertain to, and upon completion sprites and other outside resources will also be credited.
